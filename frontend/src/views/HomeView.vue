    <p>
      I love movies. New movies, old movies, award winners and cult classics, I love them all. 
      This website was designed to help me keep track of the movies I've watched and those 
      that I want to watch. <router-link to="/movies">Movies</router-link> can be filtered 
      by genre, actor, director, or production company. Every so often I'll jot down a 
      movie <router-link to="/reviews">review</router-link>. Reviews can be sorted by 
    </p>
    <h2>Behind the name <em>Miles of Movies</em></h2>
    <h3>Footage</h3>
    <p>Even though most video is digital now, we still refer to footage: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Roll that beautiful bean footage... "</li>
      <li>"Dramatic footage of the devastating tornado aftermath... "</li>
      <li>"Newly released body camera footage reveals... "</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>Film is measured in feet, and raw, unedited video was and still is referred to as "footage."</p>
    <h3>Frame rate and footage</h3>
    <p>
      The standard frame rate for movies is 24 frames per second. The most common film format, 
      35 mm, has a frame size of 36 by 24 mm. Doing some quick back of the napkin math, and an average
      two hour movie would equal 10,800 feet of film, or more than two miles of film!

    <p>
      I have miles and miles of movies to watch, and the list just keeps getting longer.
